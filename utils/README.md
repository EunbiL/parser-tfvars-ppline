### Function Descriptions

1. `printhcl(mydict, ident=False)`:
   - Converts a Python dictionary to HCL tfvars format.
   - Parameters: `mydict` (Dict), `ident` (Boolean, optional).
   - Returns a multi-line string in HCL format.

2. `tfvars_to_dict(tfvars_file)`:
   - Converts a tfvars file into a Python dictionary using the `pyhcl` library.
   - Parameters: `tfvars_file` (str).
   - Returns the Python dictionary containing the tfvars data.

3. `check_exp(segment)`:
   - Checks and corrects specific string segments, especially those with 'EXP' which is not used with ENV: SYNC or HTBT.
   - Parameters: `segment` (str).
   - Returns the corrected segment string or `None`.

4. `check_class(segment)`:
   - Checks and corrects specific string segments, especially those with CLASS which is not used with ENV: DEVS or DEVT.
   - Parameters: `segment` (str).
   - Returns the corrected segment string or `None`.

5. `check_ls(segment)`:
   - Checks and corrects specific string segments which must all end with LS.
   - Parameters: `segment` (str).
   - Returns the corrected segment string or `None`.

5. `match_segment(data)`:
   - Processes and manipulates data dictionaries, correcting segment names, and writes the result to an output tfvars file.
   - Parameters: `data` (Dict).
   - No direct return value; it modifies and writes data to an output tfvars file.




### Next Steps

1. **Enhance Naming Convention Checks:**
   - Consider extending the `check_`  functions to cover more naming conventions. For example, you can define additional rules to ensure that all segments conform to a specific naming convention.


2. **Logging and Reporting:**
   - implementing logging and reporting mechanisms to keep track of naming convention violations.
